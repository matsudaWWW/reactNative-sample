We're on React Native core version 0.62 with new community modules, native module support across multiple platforms, and our official public release of React Native for Mac.

<!--truncate-->

## Upgraded to 0.62

As promised in our previous milestone post, we're chugging along and keeping as up-to-date with the latest React Native core version as we can. That means for this latest milestone release we are on version 0.62 of React Native.

As usual this means that our getting started guides and general docs will also be updated to reflect these changes.

## New Stuff for Windows!

We've started addressing the Windows community module support gap - starting with two contributions from us! The **WebView** and **Camera** modules.

On top of those initial two, we're looking at a whole bunch of other ones we know are awesome and essential to have when building a React Native app in general. Check out the full list of what we're tracking and planning to tackle next on our [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/projects/23) for modules.

We're also introducing release stages!

## React Native on the Surface Duo

React Native runs on the Surface Duo!

This is a little bit to be expected, as React Native works great today with Android, but just running on the new Surface Duo device isn't enough. We've also added support for awareness of the dual-screen device and it's status through shipping two important APIs: **TwoPaneView** and **DeviceInfoModule**.

To learn more about developing on the Surface Duo with React Native, [go check out our latest blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/surface-duo/build-react-native-apps-for-microsoft-surface-duo/) detailing the experience.
