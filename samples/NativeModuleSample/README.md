* [Native Modules and React Native Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/blob/master/vnext/docs/NativeModules.md)

>**Note: Don't build your own projects directly out of these samples. When you publish a native module (as source), you'll want to create a new project with the correct metadata. This will also make sure that you're using unique identifiers in your project files to avoid conflicts with other native modules.**
