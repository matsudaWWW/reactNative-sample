# Calculator - React Native for Windows
This sample showcases the usage of React Native for Windows vNext to build a simple calculator.

### Requirements
Make sure to have, on your machine, the correct configuration to build and run React Native for Windows projects, as highlighted [here](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/blob/master/vnext/docs/GettingStarted.md).

### Launch Calculator
To run the Calculator project as a standalone Windows application, open the **Calculator** folder and run the following command:

```powershell
react-native run-windows
```

The command will take care of building React Native for Windows, deploy the application and then launch Metro bundler and the dev tools.
